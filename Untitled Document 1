\section{Question 2.3}



\subsection{Part A-The DFA}

States correspond to the eight combinations of switch positions, and also must indicate whether the previous roll came out at D, i.e., whether the previous input was accepted. Let 0 represent a position to the left (as in the diagram) and 1 a position to the right. Each state can be represented by a sequence of three 0's or 1's, representing the directions of the three switches, in order from left to right. We follow these three bits by either a indicating it is an accepting state or r, indicating rejection. Of the 16 possible states, it turns out that only 13 are accessible from the initial state, 000r.



\subsection{The transition table}
	The following is the transition table for the 13 states accessible from 000r.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l || c | r| }
State & A & B \\ \hline
000r &    100r &	011r \\
*000a &	100r &	011r \\
001a$*$	 & 101r &	000a \\
010r	& 110r &	001a \\
010a$*$	 &110r &	001a \\
011r &	111r &	010a\\
100r & 010r &	111r \\
100a$*$	 & 010r &	111r \\
101r &	011r &	100a \\
101a$*$	 & 011r &	100a \\
110r &	000a &	101a \\
110a$*$	 & 000a	& 101a \\
111r &	001a &	110a \\ \hline

The final/accepting states are marked by $*$ symbol.

\section{Question 2.6}

\subsection{Part A}

 This DFA accepts strings of the form  000.....00011111...1. In regular expression notation 0$\textsuperscript{*}$1$\textsuperscript{*}$.

\subsection{Part B}

All strings of zeros and one ending with 101. In regular expression notation $(1+0)\textsuperscript{*}$101.


\section {Question 2.7}

\subsection{Informal Proof}

1) If for a string x the automata enters the state $q_3$ it is clear that the string is rejected. This happens iff the string contains unequal number of ones and zeros. So consider that in this case the string x is \textit{improper}. \\
2) If the string x enters the state $q_0$ implies that it is accepted. Thus x contains equal number of 1s and 0s. at this point. This is also the starting state. Consider this x as \textit{proper}. \\
3) Let x be a proper string. And y be substring of x such that $\delta(q_0,y)=q_0$. When next input is 0, it proceeds to state $q_1$. At this point the substring contains one more zero than the total number of ones. If the input is 1, it proceeds to state $q_2$. At this point the substring contains one more one than the total number of zeros.

\subsection{Mathematical Proof}

For the given question we say that a string is \textit{proper} if each prefix of x has at most one more zero than one and at most one more 1 than 0. We argue by induction on the lenght of the string x that: \\
1) $\delta(q_0,x)=q_0$ iff x is proper and contains an equal number of 0s and 1s. \\
2) $\delta(q_0,x)=q_1$ iff x is proper and contains one more 0 than 1s. \\
3) $\delta(q_0,x)=q_2$ iff x is proper and contains one more 1 than 0s. \\
4) $\delta(q_0,x)=q_3$ iff x is not proper. \\
The induction hypothesis is stronger than a bare notion and an informal proof. Conditions (2),(3), and (4) are added to allow the induction to go through. \\
We prove the iff portion of (1) through (4) first. The basis of induction, $|x|=0$, follows since the empty string has an equal number of 0's and 1's and $\delta(q_0,\epsilon)=q_0$. \\
Assume the induction hypothesis is true for all x, $|x|<n,n\geq1$. Consider a string y of length n, such that y is proper. First considerthe case the y ends in 0. Then y=x0, where x is proper and has one more 1 than 0s. Thus  $\delta(q_0,x)=q_2$. Hence $\delta(q_0,y)=\delta(q_0,x0)=\delta(q_2,0)=q_0$. \\
The case where y ends in a 1 is handled similarly.
Next consider a string y, $|y|=n$ such that y is proper and has one more 0 than 1. If y=x0, then x has two more 0s than 1s, contradicting the fact that y is proper. Thus, y =x1, where x is proper and has an equal number of zeros and ones. By induction hypothesis, $\delta(q_0,x)=q_0$; hence $\delta(q_0,y)=q_1$. The situation where y is proper and has one more 1 than 0, and the situation where y is not proper is treated similarly.\\
We must now show that strings reaching each state have the interpretations given in state (1) through (4).Suppose that $\delta(q_0,y)=q_0$ and $|y|\geq1$. If y=x0, then $\delta(q_0,x)=q_2$, since $q_2$ is the only state with a 0-transition to $q_0$. Thus by induction hypothesis x is proper and has one more 1 than 0. Thus y is proper and has an equal number of 0s and 1s. The case where y ends in a 1 is similar, as are the cases $\delta(q_0,y)=q_1,q_2, or q_3$.

\section {Question 2.9}
 
\subsection{Part A}

Given NFA is  $(Q_a, \{0,1\}, \hat{\delta_1}, [p], F_a)$. Where $Q_a =\{p,q,r,s\}, F_a=\{s\}$.
The resulting DFA transition table with the possible states is tabulated below.

 \begin{center} 
 \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|}
    State &0 &1 \\ \hline
    $[p]$ &$[p,q]$ &$[p]$\\
    $[p,q]$ &$[p,q,r]$ &$[p,r]$\\
    $[p,r]$ &$[p,q,s]$ &$[p]$\\
    $[p,s]*$ &$[p,q,s]$ &$[p,s]$\\
    $[p,q,r]$ &$[p,q,r,s]$ &$[p,r]$\\
    $[p,q,s]*$ &$[p,q,r,s]$ &$[p,r,s]$\\
    $[p,r,s]*$ &$[p,q,s]$ &$[p,s]$\\
    $[p,q,r,s]*$ &$[p,q,r,s]$ &$[p,r,s]$\\ \hline
    \end{tabular} 
\end{center}

Therefore the final accepting states are  $F_a = \{ [p,s], [p,q,s], [p,r,s], [p,q,r,s] \}$

\subsection{Part B}

Given NFA is $(Q_b, \{0,1\}, \hat{\delta_2}, [p], F_b)$. Where $Q_a =\{p,q,r,s\}, F_a=\{q,s\}$.
The resulting DFA transition table with the possible states is tabulated below.

\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|}
    State &0 &1 \\ \hline
    $[p]$ &$[q,s]$ &$[q]$ \\
    $[q]$ &$[r]$ &$[q,r]$ \\
    $[r]$ &$[s]$ &$[p]$ \\
    $[s]$ &$\phi$ &$[p]$ \\
    $[q,r]$ &$[r,s]$ &$[p,q,r]$ \\
    $[q,s]$ &$[r]$ &$[p,q,r]$ \\
    $[r,s]$ &$[s]$ &$[p]$ \\
    $[p,q,r]$ &$[q,r,s]$ &$[p,q,r]$ \\
    $[q,r,s]$ &$[r,s]$ &$[p,q,r]$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
 \end{center}

Therefore the final accepting states are  $F_b = \{ [q], [s], [q,s], [q,r], [r,s], [p,q,r], [q,r,s] \}$
